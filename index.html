            <p id="" class="text-primary heading"> Depression is an incredibly consequential problem which can shake the very future of a person. Depression can really ruin your social factor of life like talking to your friends or making new ones. If you don't have friends then you will get lonely, this will only increase your depression. So if you have depression it will impact your social life deeply. Because of COVID a lot of people lost their jobs and the people who couldn't afford online education were forced to drop from their schools. Not only that but depression could also happen due to various other reasons. A lot of people suffer because of this and then when they start going into the depth of negativity, anxiety, indecisiveness etc then they tend to become suicidal. Here we will be talking about this widespread disease, how this really happens and affects our lives. </p>

                   <p class="heading">1 Depression is big mental health problem which causes a loss of interest in activities and extreme sadness. It affects how you feel, think and behave, it can even cause physical, functional and emotional problems. Depression can occur anytime in you life and you might have different symptoms so watch out. This isn't something that you can overcome from just willpower, you need something more to get rid of this. What you need is a treatment and if you ever think of harming youself then you need a treatment right away. Most people might think the cause of this is just something psychological which is true but there are many other factors which may lead to depression.

                    It is said that depression (in terms of science) comes from chemical disparity, but this does not show how many factors the disease actually has. Depression does not come from having too much and too less brain chemcials, there are many possibilities in how it can occur, one of them being a problem with mood regulation by the brain. Specifc areas of the brain regulate mood for example nerve cell connections and nerve cell growth, the fuctioning of the nerve circuits play a major role in depression. The hippocampus part of the brain (the part in charge of emotional memory) can be seen decreasing when the person goes into depression, the cells and networks that make up that part start to fade, this is a huge factor that contributes to depression. The Amygdala part of the brain which controls major emotions like anger, pleasure, sadness and fear is seen to have high activity in people with depression (As you know when you have depression you have major mood changes so it is likely that the part which controls your emotions is getting higher activity then normal). The Thalamus part of the brain which combines sensory information is known to have high density nerve cells which have been proven that they are linked to depression.

                    Neurotransmitters (as you know) are affected a lot when a person goes into depression. People who are extremely depressed might get their complex systems go wrong. For example receptors might go oversensitive or insensitive for a specific neurotransmitter, causing the neurotransmitter to be very uncontrolled or unsufficient, both of which do not produce the best of results. There are three main Neurotransmitters linked to depression. The neurotransmitter Dopamine which deals with pleasure and rewards is known to have unusual activity levels when a person is in depression giving us a hypothesis that the activity levels might be related to depression. Then there is the neurotransmitter Norepinephrine which controls attention and heart rate, the changes in activity might be related to the lack of focus and interest in people who have depression. Finally the neurotransmitter Serotonin which controls Mood and pain, the changes include signaling, receptor activity and it is also believed that this neurotransmitter is also linked to suicide (but it is not the main cause of depression as it was once believed). These neurotransmitters and system faults can affect your mood at an incredibly high rate.

                    Stress is also part of depression and its effects grow very evidently throughout the body. The Amygdala part of the brain (it has been mentioned above) also plays a role in stress as the activity of stress grows higher in there. People who have depression have higher levels of CRH which triggers stress. There is a small part of the brain called Hypothalamus which reacts to a stressor and sends out signal which activiates the production of stress hormones (adrenaline and cortisol mostly). Adrenaline affects things like your vital signs, for example it increases your heart rate and may raise your blood pressure thus giving you an excess amount of air which can give you an energy boost. Cortisol also gives you a energy boost but stops your digestion until the stress which you are experiencing stops. All in all stress activates many chemical reactions and responses throughout the body. If you are in stress for only a short time then your body returns to normal but if you have been experiencing stress for a long time then the changes in your body might be long lasting.

                     There is medical treatment for this (not including meditation etc). The medicine known for this is called antidepressant. These actually try to balance out the neurotransmitter levels so that the chemical messengers go back to normal and thus stop depression. They increase the concentration between the chemical messengers though this does not immediately affect the person, for some peole it might take days or weeks or even months so don't expect the medicine to immediately effect. There are many types of antidepressants and are chosen as per the neurotransmitters which are giving you the most trouble or they can also be chosen as per your family who had depression and the doctors might give you the same medicine. The antidepressants include SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs, NDRIs and the Non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. All of these medicines can affect only the specific neurotransmitters which are meant for them.
